This is TinDog, a dating website for dogs!
I did the project alongside to my teacher Dr. Angela Yu in the Web Development Bootcamp, in which I had the chance to practice and develop my knowlodge in HTML, CSS and Bootstrap. Besides that, I learnt the importance of making reponsive websites and writing the code as clean as possible.
I hope you enjoy!
